The email-bugs -> be-handle-mail import is based on `be import-xml`.
The current import-xml implementation allows good control over what
gets overwritten during a merge by overriding only those fields
defined in the incoming XML.

For clients without the versioned bugdir (e.g. they installed via a
release tarball or their distro's packaging system), `be email-bugs`
will not know what fields have been changed/added/etc., so it sets
_all_ the fields in the outgoing XML.  Importing that XML file will
override any changes that may have been made to the listed
bugs/comments between the release and your current source version, so
you may have to do some manual tweaking of the post-merge bugdir.

One possible workaround would be to change the merge algorithm in
import-xml to take advantage of version information given in the XML
file.  import-xml could checkout the shared root version of any
modified bugs, and compute the changes made by the remote user and
those made in the local tree.  It could then merge these changes more
intelligently, by prompting the user, keeping the local changes,
keeping the remote changes, etc.

While the more automated approach might be better, it's also more
complicated, so for now we'll stick with the simple "override all
fields defined in the XML" approach.
