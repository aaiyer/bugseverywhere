Either of these could be added at the
  libbe.command.base.Command.run
level.

The Git hooks would be 'pre-<command-name>' and 'post-<command-name>'.

Oh, and the hooks are therefore command-level hooks, not storage-level
hooks.  We still want storage-level hooks for notification emails, etc,
and they would definately have to follow the Git directory approach.
Hmm.  Storage level hooks will be awkward...
