I believe I planned to store it as an alpha-sorted, one-entry-per-line
list, so it would support merging easily.

Well, it really depends how much semantics you want to embed in the data
format.  Some values are scalars, some may be sets (i.e. tags), some may
be ordered lists or even mappings.  How much you want to reflect that in
the data format is up to you.

I don't find the term mix-in very intuitive here.

"append" usually has two "p"s.  Is the omission deliberate?

It sounds pretty complicated.  I would probably use a type system rather
than "mixins", and define types as "scalar", "set" and maybe "list" and
"map".  Dependencies would be a set, and their special behaviour would
be hardcoded according to their name, not a property of their type.
