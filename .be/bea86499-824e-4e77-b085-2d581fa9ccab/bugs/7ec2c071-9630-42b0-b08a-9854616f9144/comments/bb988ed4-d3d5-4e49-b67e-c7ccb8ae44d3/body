That is a much better format than my unmergable one ;).

Nope, sorry :p

Ok.  I'm just worried about bloat.  It's pretty easy to move things
around at the moment, but I'm worried that adding lots of attributes
with special code will start a slippery slope of trying to satisfy
everybody internally.  Then things start looking more like Arch, with
newbies scared off by the confusion.  I know the Arch people like the
power, but it took me several hours to figure out how to create a
repository ;).  Some people like bug dependencies, and some do not
  e.g.
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/malone/+bug/95419
    http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/31

From the *long* Trac post, you can see that this is divisive issue.

I would be in favor of emulating TracCrossReferences
(http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracCrossReferences) in our core.  We
could have references and backlinks fields for bugs (and comments?).
But I'd rather not add blocking, etc.  However, having a seperate
plugin obviously doesn't work for some people ;).  We'd like to bundle
lots of functionality, but keep the core fairly clean and flexible.

Therefore, I'd like a way to put non-core implememtation code in a
seperate submod.  We already call our libbe code "plugins", and we're
extending the builtin BugDir, Bug, etc code, so I thought we'd call
the non-core submods mixins (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin).

Anyhow, just my 2c.
