I'm not as convinced they are a good idea as I once was.  I've just
added comments-from-stdin, e.g.
  some-invalid-command | be comment <bug-id> -
Which is mostly what I'd be using attachments for anyway.  If you
really want to support the attachments/mime-types etc. like we had
maybe been leaning towards before, you'd need to look at the output of
`be show ...' with an email client, which seems a bit excessive.  Do
we even want mime types at all?  With the xml output a la Thomas, you
should be able to pipe into whatever sort of `viewer' you want, and it
doesn't end up being hardcoded into the main repo.


Notes since my email:

be->xml->mutt has since been implemented, and it preserves comment
mime-type.  This allows those that want to go crazy to attach whatever
they want to their comments:

  $ echo "<html><head></head><body>Hello world</body></html>" | be comment --content-type text/html 576:2 -

I think non-text attachments without a browser/mail-viewer don't make
sense, so I'm closing this bug.  Feel free to keep it open in your own
repo, or argue with me on the list ;).
