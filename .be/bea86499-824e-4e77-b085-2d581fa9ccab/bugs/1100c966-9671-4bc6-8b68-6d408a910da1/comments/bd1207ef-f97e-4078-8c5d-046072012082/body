Some additional thoughts, as I've been developing this idea:

Different BE storage versions will be difficult to handle.
We currently do disk upgrades via
  libbe.storage.util.upgrade
which browses through the .be/ directory, making appropriate changes.

The new formats know very little about paths, which brought on the
whole libbe.storage.vcs.base.CachedPathID bit.  Still, most VCSs
seem to be able to handle renames, e.g.
  $ bzr cat -r 200 ./libbe/command/new.py
works, when as of revision 200, the file was
  ./becommands/new.py
In fact, bzr recognizes both names:
  $ diff <(bzr cat -r 200 ./becommands/new.py) \
         <(bzr cat -r 200 ./libbe/commands/new.py)
returns nothing.  Still, I'm not sure this is something we should
require in a storage backend.  Which means we'd need to have a
version-dependent id-to-path(version) function.

We also have the unfortunate situation of duplicate UUIDs from the old
  be merge
implemtation.  This means that id-to-path is not a well defined
mapping with single-uuid ids.  That's ok though, we get a bit uglier
and send the long_user() id into the storage backend instead.  While
not so elegant, this will avoid the need for the cached id/path table.

Ok, you say, we're fine if we have the compound bugdir/bug/comment ids
going out to storage, with the upgrader upgrading the file
appropriately for each file type.  Almost.  You'll still run into
trouble with upgrades like dir format v1.2 to 1.3 where targets
moved from a per-bug string to a seperate-bugs-with-dependencies.
Now you need to create virtual-target-bugs on the fly when you're
loading the old bugs.  Yuck.

All of this makes me wonder how much we care about being able to
see bug diffs for any repository format older than the current one.
I think that we don't really care ;).  After all, the on-disk
format should settle down as BE matures :p.  When you _do_ want
to see the long-term history of a particular bug, there's always
  bzr log .be/123/bugs/456/values
or the equivalent for your VCS.  If access to the raw log ends
up being important, it should be very easy to add
  libbe.storage.base.VersionedStorage.log(id)
  libbe.command.log
