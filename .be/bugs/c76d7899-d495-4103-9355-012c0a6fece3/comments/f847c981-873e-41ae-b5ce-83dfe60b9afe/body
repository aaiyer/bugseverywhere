I think that approach doesn't give features the richness they need.
Features also have severities-- some features are important, and others
are just nice-to-have.  And there should be a way to list *only* bugs,
or *only* features.

In a bug tracker, "wishlist" is either an aberration, or it means a very
low severity.
