Installing BE
*************

Distribution packages
=====================

Some distributions (Debian_ , Ubuntu_ , others?) package BE.  If
you're running one of those distributions, you can install the package
with your regular package manager.  For Debian, Ubuntu, and related
distros, that's::

    $ apt-get install bugs-everywhere

However, the official packages can lag behind current development.

If you're running Gentoo_, I've got a live ebuild in my overlay_ that
installs the current version of BE from the Git source.

Michel Alexandre Salim maintains a Fedora_ package.

Dependencies
============

If your distribution does not package BE, you'll have to install it
yourself, along with its dependencies.  Not all of these are strictly
required.  See `Minimal installs`_ for possible shortcuts.

Git repository
==============

BE is available as a Git repository::

    $ git clone git://gitorious.org/be/be.git be

See the homepage_ for details.  If you do branch the Git repo, you'll
need to run::

    $ make

to build some auto-generated files (e.g. :py:mod:`libbe._version`), and::

    $ make install

to install BE.  By default BE will install into your home directory,
but you can tweak the ``INSTALL_OPTIONS`` variable in ``Makefile`` to
install to another location.  With the default installation, you may
need to add ``~/.local/bin/`` to your ``PATH`` so that your shell can
find the installed ``be`` script.

Minimal installs
----------------

By default, ``make`` builds both a man page for ``be`` and the HTML
Sphinx documentation (:doc:`doc`).  You can customize the
documentation targets (if, for example, you don't want to install
Sphinx) by overriding_ the ``DOC`` variable.  For example, to disable
all documentation during a build/install, run::

    $ make DOC= install

Note that ``setup.py`` (called during ``make install``) will install
the man page (``doc/man/be.1``) if it exists, so::

    $ make
    $ make DOC= install

*will* build (first ``make``) and install (second ``make``) the man
page.

Also note that there is no need to edit the ``Makefile`` to change any
of its internal variables.  You can `override them from the command
line`__, as we did for ``DOC`` above.

__ overriding_

Finally, if you want to do the absolute minimum required to install BE
locally, you can skip the ``Makefile`` entirely, and just use
``setup.py`` directly::

    $ python setup.py install

See::

    $ python setup.py install --help

for a list of installation options.

You will still need to install PyYAML.  Jinja is only used by the
``html`` command, so feel free to skip Jinja if you don't mind
avoiding that command.  Similarly, CherryPy is only used for the
``serve-*`` commands.  The other dependencies are only used for
:doc:`building these docs <doc>`, so feel free to skip them and just
use the docs wherever you're currently reading them.

Release tarballs
================

For those not interested in the cutting edge, or those who don't want
to worry about installing Git, we'll `post release tarballs`_
(once we actually make a release).  After you've downloaded the
release tarball, unpack it with::

    $ tar -xzvf be-<VERSION>.tar.gz

And install it with:::

    $ cd be-<VERSION>
    $ make install
