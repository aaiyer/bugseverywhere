"""Define :class:`Tree`, a traversable tree structure.
"""

class Tree(list):
    """A traversable tree structure.

    Examples
    --------

    Construct::

               +-b---d-g
             a-+   +-e
               +-c-+-f-h-i

    with

    >>> i = Tree();       i.n = "i"
    >>> h = Tree([i]);    h.n = "h"
    >>> f = Tree([h]);    f.n = "f"
    >>> e = Tree();       e.n = "e"
    >>> c = Tree([f,e]);  c.n = "c"
    >>> g = Tree();       g.n = "g"
    >>> d = Tree([g]);    d.n = "d"
    >>> b = Tree([d]);    b.n = "b"
    >>> a = Tree();       a.n = "a"
    >>> a.append(c)
    >>> a.append(b)

    Get the longest branch length with

    >>> a.branch_len()
    5

    Sort the tree recursively.  Here we sort longest branch length
    first.

    >>> a.sort(key=lambda node : -node.branch_len())
    >>> "".join([node.n for node in a.traverse()])
    'acfhiebdg'

    And here we sort shortest branch length first.

    >>> a.sort(key=lambda node : node.branch_len())
    >>> "".join([node.n for node in a.traverse()])
    'abdgcefhi'

    We can also do breadth-first traverses.

    >>> "".join([node.n for node in a.traverse(depth_first=False)])
    'abcdefghi'

    Serialize the tree with depth marking branches.

    >>> for depth,node in a.thread():
    ...     print "%*s" % (2*depth+1, node.n)
    a
      b
        d
          g
      c
        e
        f
          h
            i

    Flattening the thread disables depth increases except at
    branch splits.

    >>> for depth,node in a.thread(flatten=True):
    ...     print "%*s" % (2*depth+1, node.n)
    a
      b
      d
      g
    c
      e
    f
    h
    i

    We can also check if a node is contained in a tree.

    >>> a.has_descendant(g)
    True
    >>> c.has_descendant(g)
    False
    >>> a.has_descendant(a)
    False
    >>> a.has_descendant(a, match_self=True)
    True

        inheritance is explicit, but you can end up with highly
        indented threads.

        When `flatten` is `True`, the depth of any node is only
        greater than the depth of its parent when there is a branch,
        and the node is not the last child.  This can lead to ancestry
        ambiguity, but keeps the total indentation down.  For example::
