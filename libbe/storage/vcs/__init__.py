"""Define the Version Controlled System (VCS)-based
:class:`~libbe.storage.base.Storage` and
:class:`~libbe.storage.base.VersionedStorage` implementations.

There is a base class (:class:`~libbe.storage.vcs.VCS`) translating 
Storage language to VCS language, and a number of `VCS` implementations:

* :class:`~libbe.storage.vcs.arch.Arch`
* :class:`~libbe.storage.vcs.bzr.Bzr`
* :class:`~libbe.storage.vcs.darcs.Darcs`
* :class:`~libbe.storage.vcs.git.Git`
* :class:`~libbe.storage.vcs.hg.Hg`

The base `VCS` class also serves as a filesystem Storage backend (not
versioning) in the event that a user has no VCS installed.
